# JavaBasics
The Java files accompanying the JavaBasics assignments.  


Assignment #1:

Use the file Variables.java.

Define 2 variables of each of the following data types.
Use Scanner to ask the user for the values for the variables.

* byte
* short
* int
* float
* double
* Strings

For these two data types, assign them a value without asking the user.
* char
* boolean


Create a new byte variable that holds the sum of the two bytes previously created.
(Use the variable names to do the addition.  - You may need to typecast!) 

Do the same with the short, int, float, double, and char. 

Print the value of one variable from each type to the screen continuing the format provided in the file. 


Assignment #2: 

Use the file DoTheMath.java.

In the main method, use Scanner to ask the user for two integers.  Save the values to two int variables.

Create methods to add, subtract, multiple, and divide these two numbers.

Print the information to the screen from within the individual methods. 


Assignment #3: 

Use the file Rectangle.java.  

In the main method, use Scanner to ask the user for two integers.  Save these values to two variables.
