# JavaBasics
The Java files accompanying the JavaBasics assignments.  


Assignment #1:

Use the file Variables.java.

Define 2 variables of each of the following data types.
Use Scanner to ask the user for the values for the variables.

* byte
* short
* int
* float
* double
* Strings

For these two data types, assign them a value without asking the user.
* char
* boolean


Create a new byte variable that holds the sum of the two bytes previously created.
(Use the variable names to do the addition.  - You may need to typecast!) 

Do the same with the short, int, float, double, and char. 

Print the value of one variable from each type to the screen continuing the format provided in the file. 


Assignment #2: 

Use the file DoTheMath.java.

In the main method, use Scanner to ask the user for two integers.  Save the values to two int variables.

Add, subtract, multiple, and divide these two numbers.  Create one expression that uses each operator (including mod) at least once.

Print the expressions and the results.



Assignment #3: 

Use the file Rectangle.java.  

In the main method, use Scanner to ask the user for two values.  Save these values to two variables.  What type of variable is the best to use here?

Calculate the area and perimater of the rectangle.

Print the information to the screen as part of a sentence.  Example:  "The side lengths were ___ and ___ .  The area is ___ .  The perimeter is ___ ." 

Assignment #4:

Use the file Temperature.java.

In the main method, use Scanner to ask the user for two values - one is a temperature in Celsius and the other is a temperature in Fahrenheit.  

For the Celsius temperature, convert it to Fahrenheit and print both the original value and the result as part of a sentence.

For the Fahrenheit temperature, convert it to Celsius and print both the original value and the result as part of a sentence.
